# We are on the air!

Welcome to the website of the **Radio Ninja Pirata** project.

**Radio Ninja Pirata streams dynamic playlists on Spotify**.

Surely many of you are wondering, what on earth is Radio Ninja Pirata - yet another radio? Not at all! Our concept is an entirely different one. Stay tuned and read bellow our philosophy:

**Our motivation:** We are sick and tired of the “best songs”, “the most popular” from the 10 most known artists; web radios radios and broadcasted radios are always like this. Here we are developing a radio project where every artist has the same chance to be played, and their whole discography is considered, no privileges are given, **a genuinely egalitarian radio**. In other words, more than radio statios, our streams are dynamic playlists!

It’s time to explore more music, it is time to explore infinity!

# How does it work?

To listen to our radios is very easy, you just need a [Spotify account](https://www.spotify.com). Why Spotify? We are not supported by Spotify whatsoever. Simply, we have used the platform for many years, so why not continue with it? We are considering in the future to expand to other platforms as well. Would you support us on that?

**Let us explain the project:** Notice that our radios are actual playlists on Spotify; you can follow and organize them like any other playlist.

**How do these playlists work as radios?** Radio Ninja Pirata's stations are dynamic playlists that self regenerate with 40 new songs every 2 hours. Previous songs disappear, and new ones come in. When a list regenerates, what happens to the current playing song? Nothing, songs continue playing without stopping, resulting in an infinite playing loop, 24/7, providing you a radio experience. You just have to play it, and it will go non-stop. You can think of our playlists are pure radio stations that feature artists' complete discographies, not only "best-of" songs.

**Which stations are available?** We are developing stations based on themes and music styles. Our aim is that listening to a station for hours long provides a seamless sound experience without unexpected jumps on form and rhythm. The artists that play on each radio are selected based on the radio theme. We try to gather as many artists as possible and as many styles as possible, not only those most famous but also those not under the lights of big fame. Our aim is to get people to know more music.

**How are the songs selected?** To select a song, we first randomly choose an author of the authors' catalog that constitute the station. After that, we randomly select a track from the whole artist's catalog on Spotify. This process is repeated for every song added to the radio station. Therefore, all artists have the same probability of being played at each song selection. And, believe us, some times random creates very nice musical connections ;-)

We are in active development, some radios are experimental, others are nicely established. Have a look, and stay tuned! ;-)

Hey, we are under construction :-) we will continue creating more and more.

Stay tuned!
