# We are on the air!

Welcome to the website of the **Radio Ninja Pirata** project.

**Radio Ninja Pirata hosts music radio stations on Spotify**.

**Our motivation:** We are *sick and tired* of the "best songs", "the most popular" from the about 10 most known artists, Spotify radios and real-life broadcasted radios are always like this. Here we are developing a radio project where **every artist** has the same chance to be played and **ALL** songs from their discography are considered, no privileges given, **an egalitarian radio**.

It's time to explore more music!

# How does it work?

To listen to our radios is very easy, you just need a [Spotify account](https://www.spotify.com). Why Spotify? We are not supported by Spotify whatsoever, simply is the platform we have been using for many years for our personal use, and so, why not continue with it?

**Lets explain the project:** Notice that our radios are, *technically speaking*, actual playlists on Spotify; you can follow and organize them as any other playlist. Actually, following our playlist is a great way to show that you like the project and keep us motivated, we run entirely on volunteer dedication :-)

**How do these playlists work as radios then?** Radio Ninja Pirata stations are dynamic playlists that **self regenerate with 40 new songs every 2 hours**; previous songs disappear, new come in. When new songs come in, the play continues without stopping, resulting in an infinite playing loop, 24/7, providing you the experience of a radio. You just have to play it and it will go non-stop, think really about it as pure radios!

**Which stations are available?** We are developing stations based on a theme, so that listening to a station hours long provides a seamless sound experience. The artists that play on each radio are selected based on the radio theme and we try to gather as much artists as possible, not only those most famous but also those not under the lights of big fame. Our aim is to get people to know more music.

**How are songs selected?** For each song that comes in to the station: firstly, an author is selected randomly from the catalogue of authors that the station features, than we select a track from the whole artist's catalogue on Spotify - this process is repeated for every song added to the radio station. Therefore, all artists have the same probability to be played at each song selection. And, believe us, some times random creates very nice musical connections ;-)

**We are in active development, some radios are experimental, others are nicely established. Have a look and stay tuned!** ;-)
